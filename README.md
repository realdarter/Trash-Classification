# 🗑️ Trash-Classification

An AI-powered image classification model that identifies different types of materials in trash, helping users sort waste correctly and efficiently.

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-powered Trash Classifier**: Automatically detects and categorizes trash into appropriate waste types.
- **Sorting Guide Documents**: Provides information on proper disposal for:
  - ♻️ Recyclables
  - 🌱 Compostables
  - 🗑️ Landfill Waste
  - ☠️ Hazardous Waste
- **Quiz Game on Trash Sorting**: Educates users on waste management through an interactive game.

## 🧠 How the Machine Learning Model Works

The project utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image recognition, specifically leveraging **ResNet-50** from `torchvision.models`.

### CNN Architecture:
- Uses a deep learning model trained on labeled trash images.
- **Convolutional Layers** extract features from images.
- **Activation Functions** (e.g., ReLU) introduce non-linearity for better learning.
- **Pooling Layers** downsample feature maps to retain important information.
- **Loss Calculation** optimizes model accuracy.

**Dataset:**  
This project incorporates images and some pre-existing code sourced from Kaggle:
